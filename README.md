# Deep Learning for OCT Image Classification

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Deep Learning for OCT Image Classification Project, a pioneering endeavor in medical image analysis.This project explore the Deep Learning for OCT Image Classification Project, a groundbreaking effort in medical image analysis. My project utilizes a Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to classify retinal diseases in OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images. Leveraging TensorFlow and Google Colab, this project showcases the potential of deep learning in medical diagnostics. I have successfully classified retinal images into four categories: Normal, AMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration), DME (Diabetic Macular Edema), and CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization). Furthermore, My project challenges the traditional small data hypothesis by achieving similar results with only 20% of the dataset. Dive into the world of medical image analysis, access the source code, and contribute to advancing this field.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Dataset:** We leveraged a publicly available OCT image dataset, which can be accessed [here](https://data.mendeley.com/public-files/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/files/5699a1d8-d1b6-45db-bb92-b61051445347/file_downloaded).

- **Semi-Supervised GAN:** Our innovative approach allows us to classify retinal images into four categories: Normal, AMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration), DME (Diabetic Macular Edema), and CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization).

- **Small Data Hypothesis:** To test our hypothesis, we trained the model twice â€“ once with the full dataset and again with only 20% of the data. Remarkably, we achieved nearly identical results with only a minimal 1% reduction in accuracy, showcasing the robustness of our approach.
