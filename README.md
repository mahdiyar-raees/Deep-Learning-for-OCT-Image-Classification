# Deep-Learning-for-OCT-Image-Classification
Discover the power of deep learning in medical image analysis with 'Deep Learning for OCT Image Classification.' Our innovative project employs a Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, developed using TensorFlow and Google Colab resources, to classify retinal diseases in OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images
